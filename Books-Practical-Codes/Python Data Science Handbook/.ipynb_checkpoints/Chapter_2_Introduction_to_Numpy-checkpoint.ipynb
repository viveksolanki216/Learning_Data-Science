    "Python object is simply a cleverly-disguised C structure, which contains not only its value, but other information as well. For example, when we define an integer in Python, such as x = 10000, x is not just a \"raw\" integer. It's actually a pointer to a compound C structure, which contains several values.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * ob_refcnt, a reference count that helps Python silently handle memory allocation and deallocation\n",
    "  * ob_type, which encodes the type of the variable\n",
    "  * ob_size, which specifies the size of the following data members\n",
    "  * ob_digit, which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent.\n",

    "Notice the difference here: a C integer is essentially a label for a position in memory whose bytes encode an integer value. A Python integer is a pointer to a position in memory containing all the Python object information, including the bytes that contain the integer value. This extra information in the Python integer structure is what allows Python to be coded so freely and dynamically. All this additional information in Python types comes at a cost, however, which becomes especially apparent in structures that combine many of these objects.\n"

But this flexibility comes at a cost: to allow these flexible types, each item in the list must contain its own type info, reference count, and other information–that is, each item is a complete Python object. In the special case that all variables are of the same type, much of this information is redundant: it can be much more efficient to store data in a fixed-type array. The difference between a dynamic-type list and a fixed-type (NumPy-style) array is illustrated in the following figure:\n",

    "At the implementation level, the array essentially contains a single pointer to one contiguous block of data. The Python list, on the other hand, contains a pointer to a block of pointers, each of which in turn points to a full Python object like the Python integer we saw earlier. Again, the advantage of the list is flexibility: because each list element is a full structure containing both data and type information, the list can be filled with data of any desired type. Fixed-type NumPy-style arrays lack this flexibility, but are much more efficient for storing and manipulating data."

Another means of vectorizing operations is to use NumPy's broadcasting functionality.

    "In the previous sections, we saw how to access and modify portions of arrays using simple indices (e.g., arr[0]), slices (e.g., arr[:5]), and Boolean masks (e.g., arr[arr > 0]). In this section, we'll look at another style of array indexing, known as fancy indexing. Fancy indexing is like the simple indexing we've already seen, but we pass arrays of indices in place of single scalars. This allows us to very quickly access and modify complicated subsets of an array's values.\n"
